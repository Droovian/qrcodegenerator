# QR Code Generator with Express

This is a simple web application built using Express and the `qrcode` NPM package that allows users to convert a user-entered URL into a QR code. This project is a great introduction to using Express for web development and generating QR codes dynamically...

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Users can input a URL, and the application will generate a QR code that, when scanned, redirects to the specified URL.
- **Express Backend**: The server is built using the Express.js framework, which handles user requests and QR code generation.
- **Simple User Interface**: The web interface provides an easy-to-use form for entering the URL.
- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: QR codes are generated on the fly, allowing users to create QR codes for any URL they enter.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the Express server by running `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
5. You will see a form where you can enter a URL.
6. After submitting the URL, the server will generate a QR code that can be scanned.
